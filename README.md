# Overview
Previous researchers tried two methods, Logistic Regression and Multilayer Perceptron, to distinguish between two types of raisins, but the results were not very good. As a solution, i tried using an SVM model with RBF Kernel, and the result successfully increased the accuracy in classifying the types of raisins.

# Conclusion
By changing the gamma value to 0.05 and also changing the C value to 1, much better accuracy was obtained compared to the previous experiment. Therefore, we can conclude that using the SVM RBF model is very influential in classifying raisins, which results in a result from the second experiment of 92%.
