# raisin-analysis-SVM
The previous researchers tried two methods, Logistic Regression and Multilayer Perceptron, to distinguish between two types of raisins, but the results were not very good. As a solution, we tried using an SVM model with RBF Kernel, and the result successfully increased the accuracy in classifying the types of raisins.
